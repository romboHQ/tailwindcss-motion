tailwindcss-motion is a Tailwind CSS Plugin made at [RomboHQ](https://rombo.co/).
It‚Äôs a simple, yet powerful, animation library with a simple syntax.

_Motion, without commotion._

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

**1. Install npm package**

```bash
npm i -D tailwindcss-motion
```

**2. Add into your tailwind.config.js**

```js
// tailwind.config.js

export default {
     content: [...],
     theme: {
        extend: {...},
     },
     plugins: [require('tailwindcss-motion')],
};
```

**or,** to use ESM:

```js
import tailwindcssMotion from "tailwindcss-motion";

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
     content: [...],
     theme: {
          extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [tailwindcssMotion],
};
```

## How does it work?

We provide a simple syntax to animate any element in your Tailwind project. Instead of defining custom keyframes, we provide utility classes to animate every dimension, inline.

For example, for a slide and fade effect ‚Äî you simply need `motion-translate-x-in-25 motion-opacity-in-0` or, you can use one of our presets with `motion-preset-fade`

### Staggered Animations

The `motion-stagger` utility allows you to create staggered animations with incremental delays for multiple elements. This utility is useful for animating list or grid items with a smooth staggered effect.

**Usage:**

```html
<ul class="motion-stagger-100">
  <li class="motion-opacity-in-0">Item 1</li>
  <li class="motion-opacity-in-0">Item 2</li>
  <li class="motion-opacity-in-0">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In the example above, each list item will have an incremental delay of 100ms, creating a staggered animation effect.
